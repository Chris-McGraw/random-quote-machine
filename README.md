# random-quote-machine

A responsive webpage that allows users to produce a random quote at the click of a button. Upon their choosing, users can also select a separate button to tweet out their quote. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. My third project completed for https://www.freecodecamp.org/.
